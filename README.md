# [HoldToPause](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-league-blaze/p/avg_duck/HoldToPause/)

Adds a hold timer for the pause button to prevent accidental pausing in tournament situations, as well as text indicating which player paused.

The amount of time pause needs to be held as well as the location of the pause indicator (or hiding it entirely) can be changed in the mod config or with [MrGentle's ModMenu](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-league-blaze/p/MrGentle/ModMenu/).
